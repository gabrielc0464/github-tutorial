## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**: is Version Control which lets you see and keep track of the changes  
  you made to your files
  
**Github**: the same as Git but you can collaborate with others and they can also make changes to your code  
  if you allow them to.  
    Github needs Git but Git doesnt need Github
